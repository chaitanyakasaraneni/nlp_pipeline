This repository contains examples for stages in Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline. The NLP Pipeline involves the following stages.
1. Text Processing
    - Cleaning
    - Normalization
    - Tokenization
    - Stop Word Removal
    - Part of Speech Tagging
    - Named Entity Recognition
    - Stemming and Lemmatization
2. Feature Extraction
    - Bag of Words
    - TF-IDF
    - One-hot Encoding
    - Word Embeddings
3. Modeling
